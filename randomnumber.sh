# Generate a random number. This is used best when you want break up computers into groups for testing.
# Use with a reporting app to read the number and sort your computers
# For an example of that, refer to:

# v 1.1.1 -Matthew Bodaly - July 2017
# v2- Matthew Bodaly - September 2020 - Added the EA used
# Use case: All this script does is generate a random number between 1 and 10. From this point, an extension attribute (if you have Jamf Pro) reads the digit
# Once you have a random number, you can shard the fleet.
# For instance, a smart group made of random number 1 would have about 10% of the total fleet.
